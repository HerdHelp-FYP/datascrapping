African Horse Sickness (AHS), African horse sickness (AHS) is a non-contagious, vector-borne viral disease that affects all members of the Equidae family including horses, mules, donkeys, and zebras. The United States (U.S.) has never had a confirmed case of AHS; therefore, it is a foreign animal disease reportable at both the Federal and State levels. In 2020, AHS epidemics occurred outside of its normal geographic range of Africa, Oman, and Yemen, appearing in east Asia for the first time from importation of zebras from Africa to Thailand, and a subsequent detection on a farm in Malaysia. A variety of susceptible hosts, primarily equids, and competent vectors, including the biting “midge,” are present throughout North America. AHS does not affect human health. The greatest risk for AHSV introduction is associated with importation of potentially AHSV-infected zebras, donkeys, or equids with partial immunity, including those vaccinated. Infected equids can serve as a source of virus, which midges can then pass to non-infected equids. Current USDA regulations prevent the importation of these equids from known AHSV-affected countries. Risk to the U.S. is additionally associated with introduction of equids from newly affected countries not yet known to have circulating AHSV. If AHSV-infected equids entered the United States, resident biting midge populations would increase the risk of establishing a mechanism for increased transmission to our naïve U.S. equid populations. If AHSV is introduced to U.S. midge populations, reducing potential breeding grounds for biting midges, including moist soil, manure, or undrained water, can control populations and prevent them from breeding in livestock pastures. Repellents can be an effective way to temporarily decrease exposure to biting midges. Repellents may be most effective when applied to equids during the first four hours of the night, when biting midge activity is highest. Adulticide insecticides are recommended for application around horse shelters and directly to equids but not for large-scale environmental treatment. AHS is a non-contagious, infectious vector-borne disease, which means that it is not transmitted by direct contact among horses. Instead, it is usually transmitted from infected to susceptible equids by biting midges and can also be transmitted by contaminated needles and syringes. Mosquitoes, some biting flies, and other arthropods, such as ticks, might also transmit the virus from one horse to another. The signs and severity of disease depend on the clinical form of disease as well as the species of equid. Horses are more susceptible to the pulmonary and mixed forms of disease and exhibit the highest mortality rates (50% to 95%). Mortality rates in mules average 50%, with European and Asian donkeys’ mortality rates averaging around 5% to 10%. African donkeys and zebras are the least susceptible equids and thought to be the reservoirs of the virus. The virus can present in multiple forms, one affecting the pulmonary system, one affecting the cardiac system, and another that is a combination of the two. The fourth form of the disease is known as African horse sickness fever and is the mildest form. Similar clinical signs are associated with each form of the disease including fever, swelling of the face and neck, profuse sweating, coughing, mild lethargy, cardiac failure, and respiratory failure. No specific treatment exists for animals with AHS apart from rest and supportive care to alleviate clinical signs. AHS is an internationally reportable disease. If you see an equid you believe have AHS, contact your veterinarian. Suspected cases should also be reported to your State and Federal animal health officials.
Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), is a serious disease and requires rapid response because it is highly contagious and often fatal to chickens. APHIS works with its federal, state, local and industry partners to quickly mobilize a response to any HPAI findings. The goal is to quickly contain and eradicate the disease, protecting our poultry industry, and in turn, the American consumer. As leaders in animal health emergency management, we develop strategies and policies for effective incident management and help to coordinate incident response. As a liaison to outside emergency management groups, we ensure that Veterinary Services (VS) emergency management policies, strategies, and responses are consistent with national and international standards. APHIS has specific emergency response procedures in place for responding to HPAI. If your farm is ever affected by HPAI, you’ll need to know what to expect during the response process. APHIS put together a series of materials to help you understand the steps we’ll take and your responsibilities at each stage.
Classical Swine Fever, Classical swine fever (CSF) is a highly contagious and economically significant viral disease of pigs. The severity of the illness varies with the strain of the virus, the age of the pig, and the immune status of the herd. Acute infections, which are caused by highly virulent isolates and have a high mortality rate in naive herds, are more likely to be diagnosed rapidly. However, infections with less virulent isolates can be more difficult to recognize, particularly in older pigs. The range of clinical signs and its clinical similarity to other diseases can make classical swine fever challenging to diagnose. Although classical swine fever was once widespread, many countries have eradicated this disease from domesticated swine. CSF was eradicated from the U.S in 1978. Pigs are infected by the oral or nasal routes but can also enter via other mucus membranes as well as skin abrasions. CSF can be transmitted to healthy pigs coming into contact with contaminated vehicles, pens, feed, or clothing. Feeding swine untreated food wastes containing infected pork scraps can cause infection, making raw garbage feeding a major risk for CSF incursion into swine herds. Signs of CSF vary with the strain of classical swine fever virus and the age and susceptibility of the pigs. High fever, huddling, constipation followed by diarrhea and reddened eyes are often seen. The skin may show hemorrhages with discoloration of the ears, abdomen or inner thighs. Young pigs may have incoordination, or weakness. The disease can adversely affect reproduction with sows aborting or delivering stillborn or malformed piglets. Milder forms of virus or infection in partially immune pigs may exhibit mild or no symptoms and yet still harbor and spread the virus. Prevention is the best practice since there is no treatment for classical swine fever other than supportive care. Pigs that recover may shed virus for varying periods of time, serving as an infection risk to unaffected contact pigs. CSF Vaccines are available, require USDA approval for use, and can be used to assist in outbreak response efforts. The following links are to detailed descriptions of the surveillance program, targeted sampling populations and disease information upon diagnosis or suspicion of the disease.

Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), widely referred to as “mad cow disease,” is a progressive and fatal neurologic disease of cattle. It is caused by an unconventional transmissible agent, an abnormal prion protein. BSE belongs to a family of diseases known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) that includes scrapie in sheep and goats, chronic wasting disease in deer, elk and moose, and in humans, classic and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) among other syndromes. The prion agent is resistant to enzymatic breakdown and most disinfection treatments. Clinical signs in cattle include behavioral changes, coordination problems, weight loss and decreased milk production. BSE, which is not contagious, exists in two forms: classical (C-type) and atypical (L-type or H-type). The incubation period for classical BSE from time of infection, thought to occur early in life, until the onset of clinical signs averages three to six years. The primary source of infection for classical BSE is feed contaminated with the infectious prion agent, such as meat-and-bone meal containing protein derived from rendered infected cattle. Regulations from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have prohibited the inclusion of mammalian protein in feed for cattle and other ruminants since 1997 and have also prohibited high risk tissue materials in all animal feed since 2009. The atypical BSE forms, L-type and H-type, occur spontaneously at very low levels in all cattle populations, particularly in older cattle, usually eight years of age or older, and does not appear to be associated with contaminated feed. Bioassay data support the hypotheses that these strains are biologically distinct from classical BSE. Like classic or sporadic CJD in humans, it seems to arise rarely and spontaneously. BSE was first diagnosed in 1986 in the United Kingdom, which has had the vast majority of cases worldwide. However, the disease has been detected in many other countries, including six cases in the United States from 2003 to 2012. Of the six U.S. cases, the first was a case of classical BSE that was imported from Canada; the rest have been atypical BSE. BSE presents a public health concern because occurrences of variant CJD in humans have been linked to the consumption of food containing ingredients derived from BSE-infected cattle. The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) evaluates countries that submit a request and assigns a risk status for BSE based on the country’s history with the disease, the implementation and enforcement of their feed bans and their BSE surveillance. In 2013, the U.S. status for BSE was upgraded to negligible risk, the highest status available. In 2015, the OIE determined that atypical BSE occurred spontaneously at a low rate in all cattle populations and would be excluded for BSE risk. BSE is not a contagious disease and therefore is not spread through casual contact between cattle or with other species. The primary route of spread of classical BSE infection in cattle is feed contaminated with the infectious agent. Scientific evidence shows that feed contamination results from incorporating ingredients (for example, meat-and-bone meal) that contain protein derived from rendered infected cattle. Standard rendering processes do not completely inactivate the BSE agent. Therefore, rendered protein such as meat-and- bone meal derived from infected animals may contain the infectious agent. The preferred method for disposal of BSE-infected carcasses is alkaline digestion or complete, high- temperature incineration. Under no circumstances should BSE suspects be used for human or animal consumption. Agricultural officials around the world have taken actions to eradicate or control the disease. These entail prohibiting the inclusion of mammalian meat-and-bone meal in animal feed; prohibiting the use of specified risk materials or SRMs (those tissues, e.g., brain and spinal cord, known to have the highest infectivity) in food, feed, or other products; and destroying animals showing signs of BSE and other animals at high risk of developing the disease. As a result of these actions, most notably the imposition of feed bans, the rate of newly reported cases of BSE around the world has decreased to less than 10 cases annually. In 1997, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) implemented regulations that prohibit the feeding of most mammalian proteins to ruminants, including cattle. This feed ban is the most important measure to prevent the transmission of disease to cattle. In 2008, the ban was strengthened by prohibiting the inclusion of SRMs (brains and spinal cords from animals 30 months of age or older) in any animal feed. The 2008 rule also prohibits the use of all cattle carcasses not inspected and passed for human consumption, unless the cattle are less than 30 months of age, or the brains and spinal cords have been removed. An ongoing, comprehensive interagency surveillance program for BSE has been in place in the U.S. since 1990. The program targets cattle populations with the highest probability of BSE detection, including animals with neurological symptoms consistent with BSE and cattle 30 months of age or older are that are non-ambulatory, recumbent, or unable to rise or walk without assistance. Because BSE, including atypical BSE, is exceedingly uncommon among U.S. cattle, the chosen targeted population will create intentional bias in the sample frame, which favors detection of disease. APHIS also supports the FDA’s regulation prohibiting the use of most mammalian proteins in ruminant feed. The agent responsible for BSE has not been completely characterized. There are a variety of theories regarding the nature of the agent. The most widely accepted is that disease is caused by an abnormal prion protein that accumulates in the central nervous system and causes the normal cellular version of the protein to change shape such that it can no longer be degraded by the cell, causing the protein to accumulate and damage the cell. The BSE agent is extremely resistant to heat and to normal sterilization processes. It also does not evoke any detectable immune response or inflammatory reaction in host animals. In cattle naturally infected with BSE, evidence of disease has been found only in brain tissue, in the spinal cord, and in the retina. In experimentally infected cattle, the distal ileum, bone marrow, dorsal root ganglion, and trigeminal ganglion from experimentally infected cattle were also found to be infective. In March 1996, the United Kingdom’s Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) announced the identification of 10 cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) in people. These cases had a characteristic clinical and pathological phenotype that differed from other routinely diagnosed cases of classic (sporadic) CJD. SEAC concluded, and scientific evidence later confirmed, that these cases were linked to exposure to classical BSE before SRM bans were implemented. It is not known whether atypical forms of BSE (L- or H-type) are causally linked to forms of human prion diseases. In the U.S., public or human health protective measures are maintained by both the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) and the FDA. The most important public health protective measure is the removal of SRMs from the human food supply. Other controls include banning non-ambulatory disabled cattle from the human food chain; prohibiting air-injection stunning of slaughter cattle; requiring additional process controls in advanced meat-recovery systems; and forbidding the use of mechanically separated meat in human food. Additionally, protection from BSE and other disease is achieved through antemortem inspection of slaughter cattle and the exclusion from slaughter of animals with any clinical signs of neurological disease or other abnormalities. The U.S. also maintains import regulations, consistent with the OIE guidelines for BSE, to prevent BSE from entering the US through imports. Beginning in 1989, APHIS prohibited the importation of ruminants and most ruminant products from countries that had identified BSE in native cattle or that were at risk for BSE. As more research was done to help define the disease, this research also provided scientific justification to outline ways to safely trade commodities to minimize the risk of disease. This is reflected in the OIE guidelines for safe trade. APHIS current import regulations are consistent with these guidelines and allow safe trade in many bovine commodities, including meat. BSE was first diagnosed in the mid-1980s in Great Britain. BSE incidents have declined worldwide as countries have established control measures, such as feed bans. The highest number of cases was reported in 1992, with more than 37,300, and there has been a continued reduction in detections of this disease annually since then, with fewer than 10 cases annually worldwide over the past 3 years. Six cases of BSE have been identified in the U.S. The first case was detected in 2003 in Washington State in a 6 year-old dairy cow imported from Canada and confirmed as classical BSE. The subsequent five cases were confirmed as atypical BSE forms. The second, in 2005, was a 12 year-old beef cow in Texas. The third, in 2006, was a 10 year-old beef cow in Alabama. The fourth, in 2012, was a 10 year-old dairy cow in California. The fifth case, in 2017, was an 11 year-old beef cow in Alabama. The sixth case, in 2018, was a 6 year old mixed breed beef cow in Florida.
Aquaculture Information, Information on diseases that pose a significant threat to commercial aquaculture industry sectors in the U.S. APHIS VS, in collaboration with the National Aquaculture Association (NAA), has developed comprehensive aquaculture health program standards (CAHPS). These voluntary standards follow 5 principles to ensure aquatic animal health for commercial aquaculture. Guidance for national disease reporting, laboratory/testing standardization, surveillance, response, biosecurity, data management, education, and training.

African Swine Fever (ASF), African swine fever is a highly contagious and deadly viral disease affecting both domestic and feral swine of all ages. ASF is not a threat to human health and cannot be transmitted from pigs to humans. It is not a food safety issue. ASF is found in countries around the world. More recently, it has spread to the Dominican Republic and Haiti. ASF has also spread through China, Mongolia and Vietnam, as well as within parts of the European Union. It has never been found in the United States – and we want to keep it that way. APHIS is furthering its overall African swine fever (ASF) preparedness efforts with the implementation of a surveillance plan. To make this program as effective and efficient as possible, USDA will add ASF testing to our existing classical swine fever (CSF) surveillance. The plan, titled is available in the “Technical Documents” section below. APHIS has developed three new resources related to African swine fever: These documents are available in the 'Technical Documents' section below. ASF is a devastating, deadly disease that would have a significant impact on U.S. livestock producers, their communities and the economy if it were found here. There is no treatment or vaccine available for this disease. The only way to stop this disease is to depopulate all affected or exposed swine herds. USDA is working closely with other federal and state agencies, the swine industry, and producers to take the necessary actions to protect our nation’s pigs and keep this disease out. This group is also actively preparing to respond if ASF were ever detected in the U.S. Anyone who works with pigs should be familiar with the signs of ASF: Immediately report animals with any of these signs to state or federal animal health officials or call USDA’s toll-free number at for appropriate testing and investigation. Timeliness is essential to preventing the spread of ASF. On-farm biosecurity is crucial to preventing any animal disease from developing and spreading. All pig owners and anyone involved with pig operations should know and follow strict biosecurity practices to help protect U.S. pigs from ASF. Work with your veterinarian to assess your biosecurity plans and make improvements as needed. International travelers could unknowingly bring back this disease from an ASF-affected country, especially if they visit farms. Visit the APHIS traveler page to know which items you can bring back into the United States. Some food items may carry disease and threaten domestic agriculture and livestock. If you go to an ASF-affected country, do not bring back pork or pork products. Declare any international farm visits to U.S. Customs and Border Protection when you return. Make sure you thoroughly clean and disinfect, or dispose of, any clothing or shoes that you wore around pigs, before returning to the U.S. Do not visit a farm, premises with pigs, livestock market, sale barn, zoo, circus, pet store with pot-bellied pigs, or any other animal facility with pigs for at least 5 days after you return. We have many resources available to help spread the word about how to prevent ASF.
Cervids: Chronic Wasting Disease, is an infectious, degenerative disease of animals in the family cervidae (elk, deer, and moose, etc.) that causes brain cells to die, ultimately leading to the death of the affected animal. First recognized in Colorado in 1967, CWD was described as a clinical 'wasting' syndrome of unknown cause. It later became clear that CWD was a member of a group of diseases known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies or TSEs. TSEs include a number of different diseases that affect animals or humans, including (BSE or “mad cow”) in cattle, in sheep and goats, and Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (CJD), variant CJD, Kuru, fatal familial insomnia, and Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome in humans. Unlike other infectious diseases, TSEs are not caused by bacteria or viruses, but rather by a naturally occurring protein, that when folded incorrectly, becomes both infectious and deadly. The prion protein in its normal state is thought to have a role in functions such as cell signaling and neuroprotection. It is still unclear what initially causes the normal shaped protein to misfold into the infectious form. Once misfolded, the infectious prion proteins continue to convert more and more normal prion proteins to the misfolded form. Misfolding of prion proteins in the brain leads to the death of neurons (brain cells) resulting in dysfunction in the body, ultimately causing death. The incubation period can be long (several months to years) depending on species and genetic factors, and infected animals are in good body condition until the end stages of the disease, making them difficult to distinguish from healthy animals. Unfortunately, animals infected with CWD can the disease to other animals during the “silent” period. In the final stages of disease, animals become thin, drink and urinate excessively, have poor balance and coordination, lack body fat, have drooping ears, and difficulty swallowing (which is responsible for the classic drooling associated with the disease). Inability to swallow leads to aspiration pneumonia and death. Currently there is no cure or preventative measure, such as a vaccine, available for CWD. Other disease may present in a similar manner so post mortem is required to verify disease. Since its discovery in 1967 CWD has been found in a number of , Canadian provinces, Korea, and Norway, in both wild and farmed populations. The goal of the APHIS National is to provide a consistent national approach to control the incidence of CWD in farmed cervids and prevent the interstate spread if CWD. Cervid herds must participate in the program and be certified to move animals interstate.

National Brucellosis Eradication Program, Brucellosis is a contagious, costly disease. While most often found in ruminant animals (e.g., cattle, bison and cervids) and swine, brucellosis (also known as contagious abortion or Bang's disease) can affect other animals and is transmissible to humans. The disease is caused by a group of bacteria known scientifically as the genus Brucella. Three species of Brucella cause the most concern: B. abortus, principally affecting cattle, bison and cervids; B. suis, principally affecting swine and reindeer but also cattle and bison; and B. melitensis, principally affecting goats but not present in the United States. For more information, select below. For more information regarding brucellosis in humans please visit While there is no cure for brucellosis, it can be avoided by practicing proper sanitation methods and herd management strategies such as maintaining closed herds, recording individual animal identification and maintaining accurate records, isolating and testing new animals and those re-entering the herd, and arranging diagnostic workups and/or necropsies for exposed and potentially infected animals. While signs of the disease may disappear, infected animals remain diseased and are dangerous sources of infection for other animals. While the National Brucellosis Eradication Program continues to work towards this goal, the success of this Program depends on the support and participation of livestock producers. The basic approach has always been to vaccinate calves, test cattle and domestic bison for infection, and send infected animals to slaughter. Depopulation of herds, if funds are available, may be used if herds are severely affected. Identification of market animals for tracing, surveillance to find infected animals, investigation of affected herds, and vaccination of replacement calves in brucellosis-affected areas are important features of the current program. The set forth the minimum standards for states to achieve eradication. States are designated brucellosis free when none of their cattle or bison is found to be infected for 12 consecutive months under an active surveillance program. (For a listing of state brucellosis classifications, see .) APHIS conducts surveillance on animals at slaughter by testing their blood for presence of antibodies. Around two million animals are tested annually. Surveillance is more than sufficient to detect one affected herd out of 100,000 herds at a confidence level of 95%. Estimated prevalence is 0.002%. Efforts to eradicate brucellosis caused by Brucella abortus in the United States began in 1934 as part of an economic recovery program to reduce the cattle population because of the Great Depression and concurrent severe drought conditions. A number of states saw this as an opportunity to reduce the level of brucellosis, which was the most significant livestock disease problem in the US at the time. In 1934 and 1935, the reactor rate in adult Cattle tested was 11.5%. In 1954, the magnitude of the brucellosis problem in terms of economics to the cattle industry and human health prompted the United States Congress to appropriate funds for a comprehensive national effort to eradicate brucellosis. The brucellosis eradication program was designed as a cooperative effort between the federal government, the states, and livestock producers. National eradication in cattle was mostly achieved by the early 2000s, with now only an occasional spillover case in cattle in the GYA, but none elsewhere since 2010. The VS Cattle Health Program conducts reviews of State Brucellosis Eradication Programs bi-annually. VS reports and the corresponding State responses will be as they become available.
Swine: Pseudorabies, Pseudorabies is a disease of swine that can also affect cattle, dogs, cats, sheep, and goats. Pseudorabies virus (PRV) is a contagious herpesvirus that causes reproductive problems, (abortion, stillbirths), respiratory problems and occasional deaths in breeding and finishing hogs. Infected newborn pigs may exhibit central nervous system clinical signs. PRV is primarily spread through direct animal-to-animal (nose-to-nose) contact between an infected, shedding pig and a noninfected pig. It may also be spread by sexual contact. If present on inanimate objects, such as boots, clothing, feed, trucks, and equipment, the virus can also spread from herd to herd and farm to farm. Pseudorabies can be prevented primarily through biosecurity, and sound management practices that include disease control and prevention. Clinical signs in pigs depend on the age of the affected animal. In piglets central nervous systems signs, incoordination, sneezing, coughing, and high mortality. In adult pigs coughing, fever, pneumonia, central nervous systems signs, and reproductive signs such as failure to breed, abortions, mummified piglets, stillbirths, and small litters. Adult pigs often have low mortality and the virus can remain hidden in the pig in a carrier state for long periods of time. There is no treatment but antibiotic medications can control secondary bacterial infections. PRV vaccines are available, require USDA approval for use, and can be used to assist in outbreak response efforts. PRV is known to have existed in the United States for at least 150 years. Although feral swine remain as a reservoir for PRV in the United States, currently, all 50 States are considered free of PRV in commercial production swine herds. Commercial swine herds are defined as those herds which have adequate measures in place to prevent contact and potential infection from feral and transitional production swine which are known potential carriers of the PRV virus. A pseudorabies-infected herd contains animals that have tested positive serologically or have had the virus isolated in an official test conducted by an approved laboratory. No commercial total confinement production herds have been found to be infected with PRV since early 2003. Sporadic infections have been found in outdoor production herds or swine that have access to the outdoors, especially where contact with feral swine is possible. Any infected herds have been promptly depopulated when found, and intense epidemiological investigations have been conducted to ascertain that no viral spread to commercial production swine has occurred. for questions in regards to pseudorabies indemnity contact: Nicki Humphrey, DVM Veterinary Medical Officer-Swine Staff-ASEP USDA-APHIS-Veterinary Services 615-290-6146 OR John A. Korslund, DVM Swine Commodity Health Specialist USDA, APHIS, VS, Surveillance, Preparedness, and Response Services 301-851-3468 Office 301-821-7406 Cell If an accredited veterinarian suspects PRV in an animal or herd, blood samples should be collected and sent to the state diagnostic laboratory, usually a National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN) lab. The lab will conduct screening tests for PRV and submit any non-negative results to the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames, IA for confirmatory testing. PRV is a reportable disease in all states. PRV can be devastating to your breeding animals and young piglets in particular. If you have any serious breeding, nervous, respiratory or sudden unexplained death issues with sows and newborn piglets in particular, call your veterinarian to investigate. The veterinarian will most likely get blood samples and tissues (from dead piglets, for example) to submit to the veterinary diagnostic lab to help determine a diagnosis. If the cause turns out to be PRV state and federal animal health officials will also become involved in the investigation. Contact with feral swine is by far the most common method of PRV getting into your swine herd, so be sure this cannot happen through double fencing and other measures if feral swine are present in your area. Prevention is the key to dealing with this disease.
Foot and Mouth Disease, Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a severe and highly contagious viral disease. The FMD virus causes illness in cows, pigs, sheep, goats, deer, and other animals with divided hooves. It does not affect horses, dogs, or cats. FMD is a public health or food safety threat. It is also related to hand, foot, and mouth disease, which is a common childhood illness caused by a different virus. FMD is a worldwide concern as it can spread quickly and cause significant economic losses. While many countries across the globe are dealing with FMD in their livestock populations, the United States eradicated the disease here in 1929. APHIS works hard to prevent FMD from reentering the country. FMD causes production losses and hardships for farmers and ranchers. It also has serious impacts on livestock trade—a single detection of FMD will likely stop international trade completely for a period of time. Since the disease can spread widely and rapidly and has grave economic consequences, FMD is one of the animal diseases livestock owners dread most. FMD is caused by a virus. The virus survives in living tissue and in the breath, saliva, urine, and other excretions of infected animals. It can also survive in contaminated materials and the environment for several months under the right conditions. There are 7 known types and more than 60 subtypes of the FMD virus. Immunity to one type does not protect an animal against other types or subtypes. For more basic information on FMD: There are many ways you can support our efforts against FMD:

Johne's Disease, Johne's disease (pronounced "yo-knees") is a contagious, chronic and usually fatal infection that affects primarily the small intestine of ruminants. All ruminants are susceptible to Johne's disease. Johne's disease is caused by subspecies , a hardy bacteria related to the agents of leprosy and tuberculosis. The disease is worldwide in distribution. A national study of US dairies, Dairy NAHMS 96, found that approximately 22 percent of US dairy farms have at least 10% of the herd infected with Johne's disease. The study determined that infected herds experience an average loss of $40 per cow in herds with a low Johne's disease clinical cull rate while herds with a high Johne's disease clinical cull rate lost on average of $227. This loss was due to reduced milk production, early culling, and poor conditioning at culling. The cost of Johne's disease in beef herds still need to be determined. Signs of Johne's disease include weight loss and diarrhea with a normal appetite. Several weeks after the onset of diarrhea, a soft swelling may occur under the jaw (bottle jaw). Bottle jaw or intermandibular edema is due to protein loss from the bloodstream into the digestive tract. Animals at this stage of the disease will not live very long, perhaps a few weeks at most. Signs are rarely evident in cattle until two or more years after the initial infection, which usually occurs shortly after birth. Animals are most susceptible to the infection in the first year of life. Newborns most often become infected by swallowing small amounts of infected manure from the birthing environment or udder of the mother. In addition, newborns may become infected while in the uterus or by swallowing bacteria passed in milk and colostrum. Animals exposed at an older age, or exposed to a very small dose of bacteria at a young age, are not likely to develop clinical disease until they are much older than two years. Farm specific plans can be implemented to reduce economic losses and cleanup Johne's disease from the farm. For more information on Johne's disease, diagnosis, prevention, and control, contact your herd veterinarian or your State's extension office. Work with your veterinarian to develop a strategic plan for Johne's prevention and control for your farm. Some basic prevention strategies are: Consult with your veterinarian about which Johne's test is best for your situation and use an APHIS approved diagnostic laboratory. Click for a list of laboratories which have passed the Johne's serology and/or organism detection check testing.
West Nile Virus (WNV), West Nile Virus (WNV) is a viral disease in the Flavivirus family that can result in fever and neurologic disease. The virus can infect horses, humans, and many different species of birds. Clinical signs of the disease usually present within about 15 days after a bite from an infected mosquito. The virus was introduced to the United States in 1999, since then over 27,000 horses have been infected and WNV is considered an endemic disease. WNV is transmitted by infected mosquitoes. Wild birds serve as the host reservoir. When mosquitoes feed on infected birds they become infected and can transmit the virus to other birds, horses, and even humans during subsequent blood meals. Reports of equine cases of arboviral (i.e., arthropod-borne virus) diseases, including West Nile Virus, are reported to ArboNET, an electronic-based surveillance and reporting system used to track and report arboviral activity.

Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae, is a respiratory bacterium associated with economically impactful pneumonia in domestic sheep and goats since 1972, when it was first described. Although was previously reported to affect species of Caprinae (sheep, goats, and muskoxen), recent studies have identified the bacterium in animals outside Caprinae, highlighting the knowledge gaps in the basic epidemiology of this bacterium. To date, has been reported in Beira antelope, bighorn sheep, caribou, Dall sheep, moose, mountain goats, mule deer, caribou, muskoxen, white-tailed deer, and domestic cattle, sheep, and goats via a variety of diagnostic methods. The prevalence and epidemiology of is unknown for most of these species. In addition, it is unknown which species are susceptible to disease, which carry as a commensal organism, and what role susceptible species play in transmission. has been associated with polymicrobial pneumonia in both domestic sheep and bighorn sheep in the western United States. Although epizootics and high death losses of bighorn sheep associated with was first described in 2008, the epidemiology of this bacterium in bighorn sheep remains unclear. Other pathogens commonly detected in bighorn sheep pneumonia include lungworms (Protostrongylus species), , , and members of the Pasteurellaceae bacterial family. was recently detected for the first time in Dall sheep, moose, and caribou in Alaska; however, the epidemiology of the bacterium in these species is not known. In 2011, a detected by PCR test in one or more domestic sheep on 88.5% (401/453) of sheep premises and 29.4% (1,199/4,073 ) of individual sheep tested. An unpublished Alaskan study detected in 57% (4/7) of Alaskan domestic sheep premises and 7.6% (13/171) of domestic sheep, which suggests that the prevalence in Alaska may be lower than in the conterminous 48 states. Prevalence in domestic goats is less understood and studies differ. An unpublished Alaskan study detected in 4/32 domestic goat premises (12%), and in 12/485 domestic goats (2.5%), while a Washington study sampled 84 goats from 16 premises and detected in 7/16 (44%) premises (individual animal results not reported). An unpublished study, sampling goats on pack goat premises in 12 states, found in 14/83 premises (17%) and 46/571 of all goats sampled (8%), with significantly higher prevalence in those less than 1 year of age. An ongoing USDA NAHMS national study will report prevalence in U.S. domestic goats. Infection with in domestic sheep may be subclinical, and generally causes low mortality with variable morbidity. Clinical signs vary from mild respiratory disease to severe pneumonia and sudden death; this variation is believed to be related to differences in strain virulence, host immune response, and secondary pathogens. Clinical signs include lethargy, fever, decreased appetite, coughing, nasal discharge, and decreased milk production in ewes. A coughing syndrome with rectal prolapse and decreased rate of gain occurs in domestic lambs infected with . can be pathogenic but also predisposes animals to other respiratory infections, resulting in polymicrobial pneumonia. Outbreaks of severe -related pneumonia have been reported when domestic sheep were moved into higher density housing conditions or commingled. Reports of infections in bighorn sheep describe a range of clinical signs from coughing, nasal discharge, ear paresis and headshaking, to fever, lethargy, and sudden death. has been found in respiratory tracts of healthy animals and in animals with respiratory disease. Transmission occurs via respiratory droplets or secretions when animals are in close contact. Pathogen, environment, and host factors contribute to the manifestation of respiratory disease in domestic and wild ruminants. These factors include exposure to multiple viruses and bacteria (including and others), harsh climate and weather, nutritional status and deficiencies, genetics, immune system status, concurrent disease conditions, forage quality, population/stocking density, population distribution, handling/shipping stress, habitat fragmentation and destruction, and predation. Relative contributions of factors may shift temporally and seasonally and vary between geographic populations of a species, resulting in different disease outcomes between different animal populations. Recent detections of in wildlife species highlight knowledge gaps in the epidemiology of , such as the number of species that are susceptible or commensal carriers, prevalence among different species, and what role individual animals, including non-diseased carriers, may play in transmission. Factors that influence virulence and pathogenicity in susceptible species are unknown. Studies indicate that strains of differ genetically and in protein expression. More than one strain type has been identified from single domestic sheep farms, bighorn sheep herds, and even in individual domestic sheep. Causes for this variability are unknown but may be related to strain virulence, host immune responses, and other factors. Knowledge gaps remain regarding the relationship of different strain types to the development of disease in different hosts. Impacts of on bighorn sheep populations differ among studies. Studies in Hells Canyon (Washington, Idaho, and Oregon) describe population-limiting pneumonia epizootics, where is reported to be an important factor. Other states where -associated bighorn sheep pneumonia epizootics occur include California, Nevada, Nebraska, Arizona, Utah, Colorado, Montana, North and South Dakota, and Wyoming, though some herds with in Montana and Wyoming also have stable to increasing populations. This contrast suggests that other factors, aside from presence, also influence the onset of pneumonia epizootics in bighorn sheep. These factors are not fully understood and may be related to strain virulence, host, environment, and other unidentified risk factors. Impacts of on other U.S. wildlife populations are unclear. Evidence suggests has been present in Dall sheep in Alaska since at least 2004, and it has been detected in caribou and moose populations, but reports of pneumonia deaths in Alaskan wildlife are sporadic. It is unknown if the strain(s) detected in Alaskan wildlife are part of the normal respiratory commensal flora, if the animals have adapted to the strain(s), and/or if the strain(s) are virulent. Various diagnostic tests for identification have been developed, including bacterial culture, antibody-based tests including indirect hemagglutination (IH) and competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA), and DNA based tests like polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Sensitivity and specificity vary with test type and protocol. Protocols between laboratories may be different and change over time, which can result in variability in test results between laboratories. An official antemortem diagnostic test for does not exist, and currently available tests have demonstrated some variability between laboratories. Regulatory tests must be standardized and validated and the definition of disease freedom must be clearly stated regarding test results and interpretation. The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) criteria for assay development and validation include defining the assay purpose, assay optimization, assay standardization, repeatability, analytical sensitivity, analytical specificity, assay thresholds, diagnostic sensitivity, diagnostic specificity, reproducibility, and assay fitness for intended purpose. See the for a detailed description Recommended biosecurity measures to reduce likelihood of transmission of in domestic sheep and goat herds include avoiding overcrowding, improving ventilation in confinement, and using management strategies that reduce risk factors for respiratory tract disease. 1.

Vesicular Stomatitis (VS), See the Situation Reports tab below for information on the 2023 cases. Vesicular stomatitis (VS) is a viral disease that primarily affects horses and cattle and occasionally swine, sheep, goats, llamas, and alpacas. Humans can also become infected with the disease when handling affected animals, but this is a rare event. Vesicular stomatitis has been conﬁrmed only in the Western Hemisphere. It is known to be an endemic disease in the warmer regions of North, Central, and South America, and outbreaks of the disease in other temperate geographic parts of the hemisphere occur sporadically. The Southwestern and Western United States have experienced a number of vesicular stomatitis outbreaks, the most recent and largest VS outbreak occurred in 2015. Outbreaks usually occur during the warmer months, often along waterways. The time from exposure to the onset of clinical signs is 2-8 days. VS is a state reportable disease. Collect swabs of the lesions and serum to be sent to the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) for confirmation of an index case. In the event of an outbreak, your local NAHLN laboratory may become approved to test equine samples after the index case in your state is confirmed.
Equine Viral Arteritis (EVA), Equine Viral Arteritis (EVA) is a contagious viral disease in horses caused by Equine Arteritis Virus (EAV). Infection can go undetected by horse owners/breeders and in herds that were previously unexposed (naïve) abortion rates in pregnant mares can reach up to 70%. Most horses infected with EAV will show minimal if any clinical signs and recover without incident although stallions can become carriers and lifelong shedders of the virus. There is a vaccine available that has been shown to prevent infection with EAV. Vaccination should be performed at least 21 days prior to the start of breeding season to provide adequate levels of immunity. EVA has not been shown to be zoonotic. Many infections are non-clinical. Older, very young or immunocompromised horses may show more severe clinical signs which can include: EVA is spread by acutely infected horses through respiratory secretions in close contact settings (racetracks, shows, sales, etc.). The virus is also transmitted through breeding (natural service or artificial insemination). Infected stallions shed the virus in semen and can serve as long term carriers. Fomites (equipment such as buckets, brushes, shoes and humans) are another source for viral spread. Treatment is symptomatic focused on reducing swelling and inflammation and removal of edema in patients with severe clinical signs. Rest and adequate nursing care aids in resolving most cases. Be familiar with whether EVA is a reportable disease in your state and report findings accordingly.
Equine Herpesvirus (EHV), Vaccines are available to prevent the respiratory and abortion forms of EHV, but none are labeled as effective against the neurologic form of the disease (EHM). Vaccination may reduce the severity of clinical signs and may lead to reduced viral shedding. In breeding operations the use of vaccination appears to be effective at reducing the risk of EHV-1 and EHV-4 abortions and its use is strongly recommended. Pregnant mares with foals at their side should be kept in small groups and prevented from contacting new introductions. Isolate new horses for a minimum of 21 days (30 is strongly recommended), this includes returning horses who have left the farm to attend any event. Practice good hygiene and biosecurity. Equine herpes virus (EHV-1 and EHV-4) is spread via nose to nose contact, contaminated equipment (water and feed buckets, tack and grooming supplies, and shoes) and respiratory secretions within stalls/stables. Aborted fetuses and after-birth can also contain the virus. EHV-3 is spread through venereal transmission or contaminated equipment used for breeding. Treatment consists of supportive care which may include IV fluid therapy and anti-inflammatories to reduce fever. In more severe neurologic cases treatment may require hospitalization with more intensive veterinary care. The majority of horses with uncomplicated infections recover. Clinical signs may be non-specific and some horses may be non-clinical
Equine Piroplasmosis, Equine Piroplasmosis is a blood-borne protozoal infection of horses caused by and/or . Equine Piroplasmosis is present in South and Central America, the Caribbean (including Puerto Rico), Africa, the Middle East, and Eastern and Southern Europe. Only the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan, and Iceland are not considered to be endemic areas. Mortality rates for infected horses can reach 50%. Horses infected with EP can be enrolled in a USDA-APHIS-approved EP treatment program which is frequently successful at permanently eliminating the infection. EP has not been shown to be zoonotic. EP is considered a foreign animal disease in the United States and any detection must be reported to the State Veterinarian and/or the APHIS Veterinary Services Assistant Director. There are at least 14 tick species in the genera Dermacentor, Hyalomma, Amblyomma, and Rhipicephalus that may be potential natural vectors for spreading and . Ticks must feed on an EP positive horse in order to spread the organism and some tick species can serve as a reservoir transmitting the infection to future generations of ticks through its eggs. The disease can also be spread by iatrogenic means through blood and blood-contaminated equipment. The majority of cases found within the United States have been linked to the use of contaminated medical equipment (needles, syringes, IV sets, tattooing equipment, other medical tools) and/or blood products. Infection may be passed from mares to foals in utero. Clinical signs are often non-specific and can include: To prevent iatrogenic spread, never reuse needles, syringes or IV sets, use only new, clean needles with injectable medicines and use only licensed and approved blood products. Blood transfusions should be performed only by licensed veterinarians using donor horses tested negative for equine piroplasmosis and other blood-borne infections like EIA. Reduce tick exposure by keeping pastures mowed, removing brush and weeds and using topical insecticides such as pyrethroid or permethrin products. There are no vaccines available for EP prevention.
National Tuberculosis Eradication Program, Tuberculosis (TB) is a contagious disease of both animals and humans. It is caused by three specific types of bacteria that are part of the Mycobacterium group: M. bovis, M. avium, and M. tuberculosis. Bovine TB, caused by M. bovis, can be transmitted from livestock to humans and other animals. Once the most prevalent infectious disease of cattle and swine in the United States, bovine TB caused more losses among U.S. farm animals in the early part of the 20th century than all other infectious diseases combined. The National Tuberculosis Eradication Program, which is administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), State animal health agencies, and U.S. livestock producers, has nearly eradicated bovine TB from the Nation's livestock population since the program's inception in 1917. The presence of bovine TB in humans has also been reduced as a result of several factors, including the eradication program and pasteurization of milk. Many consider this one of the great animal and public health achievements in the United States; however animal health officials continue to detect TB sporadically in livestock herds. Cattle and bison usually show no clinical signs to TB unless the disease has affected multiple organ systems and is very advanced which is quite rare. Typically, infected cattle are asymptomatic and are only detected by skin testing or at slaughter during our national slaughter surveillance program. The prevalence of TB in cattle, bison and captive cervids is extremely low in the US occurring roughly 7 times per 1 million cattle herds on an annual basis. Producers can reduce their risk of getting the disease by adding only test negative livestock from known negative herds to their own herds. When TB is found in a herd, it is eliminated by either depopulating the affected herds or by testing and then removing reactor animals from affected herds. The primary source of TB surveillance is carcass inspection at all federal and state inspected slaughter establishments. The other main sources of TB detection are by testing animals during traces, pre-movement tests and finally for accredited free herd status. Live animal testing is performed by using a screening test followed by a confirmatory test if the first test is positive. Contact your for more specific information. In 1917, the US Bureau of Animal Industry began the national TB eradication program due to human and livestock concerns regarding bovine TB. It started out as strictly an eradication program for cattle but eventually included both bison and cervids. Benefits from the program are estimated at 12X the cost of the program due to decreased slaughter condemnations and decreased human infection. Although the program has been extremely successful in reducing livestock infection, there is still work left to do. The VS Cattle Health Program conducts reviews of State Tuberculosis Eradication Programs bi-annually. VS reports and the corresponding State responses will be as they become available.
What is Influenza A Virus in Swine (IAV-S), There are a number of USDA supported resources available to guide the veterinarians in options for diagnostics and vaccination: Pigs share influenza viruses the same way humans share influenza viruses, through close contact, coughing, and sneezing. It is also possible that contaminated objects (such as farming equipment) can spread the virus from infected animals to non-infected animals. Influenza viruses are common in swine, usually causing a high rate of infection but few deaths. In many instances swine show no signs of illness. Animals typically begin getting sick 1–3 days after being infected with the virus. Symptoms may include coughing or barking, sneezing, high fever, difficulty breathing, runny nose, not eating, or not wanting to get up and move around. If you see any of these signs in your pigs, try to isolate the sick animal(s) from the rest of the herd, provide supportive care, and contact your veterinarian. Vaccination prior to onset of illness with either commercially available influenza vaccines or autogenous influenza vaccines is often at least partially effective in reducing clinical signs and virus shedding. However, because these viruses can change rapidly, vaccination can sometimes fail to provide a satisfactory level of protection. : / / : / / / : / / / : / / / : / / / : / / / : / / / : / / / : / / / Internal and external program reviews were initiated in FY 2015 for APHIS’ surveillance program for influenza A virus in swine (IAV-S) to assess the program and help inform future VS budget formulation efforts. The original funding for this program was received from DHHS as part of a fiscal year (FY) 2009 supplemental appropriation in response to the H1N1 pandemic. This funding source is projected to last through FY 2016. Funding beyond FY2016 is uncertain. The assessment undertaken by APHIS’ Office for Policy and Program Development (PPD) was meant to evaluate what results had been achieved by the IAV-S surveillance program and to determine changes that would be needed as the current program is transitioned into part of a larger comprehensive surveillance program for swine. It incorporates the opinions of key stakeholders and program officials to highlight issues that may be relevant to future program management or budget formulation activities. The external review, performed under contract with an independent scientific professional, examined the technical and scientific merit of the program and made recommendations for future program efficiencies.
National Scrapie Eradication Program, The Final Rule was published in the Federal Register on March 25, 2019. APHIS believes the Final Rule will result in a more effective disease eradication program, with a more flexible approach to disease investigations and affected flock management, and more consistent animal identification and recordkeeping requirements between sheep and goats. Many of the specifics requirements regarding official eartags and official ID methods such as tattoos and implantable electronic ID (microchips) and on how indemnity is calculated were moved to the . As of November 1, 2021, section II.J. 4. (a) of the Program Standards pertaining to how commercial sheep and goat indemnity values are calculated was superseded by the . The commercial indemnity values in this table represent harmonized methods and data sources at the USDA level, and will be updated each calendar year. These commercial indemnity values are estimated based on observable market transactions available from nationally recognized data sources including the USDA Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), and the Livestock Marketing Information Center (LMIC). These data provide observations of market transactions occurring at fair market value (FMV), which provide the basis for the estimates. Changes to the methods in determining indemnity valuations were made to (1) Address stakeholder requests for a more simplified and unified approach. (2) Develop a transparent and data-driven indemnity value process to set indemnity values for all regulated species (USDA APHIS 9 CFR, Parts 50-56) and other relevant species. (3) Harmonize methods and data sources between the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) Veterinary Services (VS), USDA Farm Service Agency (FSA), and the USDA Farm Production and Conservation Business Center (FPAC-BC). Certain classes of sheep and goats are not represented in this table. A process for valuing these animals is currently being finalized. The United States is nearing the goal line after a 70-year battle against scrapie, a fatal disease that affects the brain of sheep and goats. While the current program has been very successful in drastically reducing the amount of scrapie in the US., we are still finding scrapie positive animals. The most recent two cases of scrapie found in the US were sampled at slaughter. (a sheep tested in Wisconsin in 2021, and a goat in Indiana in 2019). However, we were unable to trace these to the farms of origin. It is likely there are still farms with cases of scrapie. One of the most difficult aspects of an eradication program is finding the last few cases of the disease. This involves testing sheep and goats that are showing signs suspect of scrapie but also testing those mature animals that may be incubating the disease. Here is where we need your help! If you have an adult sheep or goat that is exhibiting such as incoordination, severe continuous rubbing or other neurologic signs, or an adult animal dies or is euthanized, or is being culled (even if you know the cause of death) please contact your local State or veterinarian or call 866-536-7593 right away. There is no charge for the collection or testing of the samples for scrapie. In addition, producers providing samples may be eligible for free official plastic tags as long as our supplies last. For a country to be considered free of scrapie, international standards require that no sheep or goats test positive for classical scrapie for seven years and a certain level of testing be done each year that represents the sheep and goat populations within the country. The annual goal set for the United States is >40,000 samples collected from mature (>18 months) sheep and goat populations. Please join your fellow producers in helping us reach this goal. Surveillance for scrapie in the United States is conducted through the National Scrapie Eradication Program (NSEP), a cooperative State-Federal-industry program. The surveillance components of the NSEP include: The program’s goals are to eradicate classical scrapie from the United States and to meet World Organization for Animal Health ( ) criteria for disease freedom. Since 2002, the prevalence of scrapie has decreased significantly through existing eradication efforts, largely a result of effective slaughter surveillance. Since slaughter surveillance stared in FY 2003, the percent of cull sheep found positive at slaughter (once adjusted for face color) has decreased 99 percent. However, in order to declare the U.S. “scrapie free”, we must be able to prove to the world that we have conducted testing in all sheep and goat populations. This is why your from sheep/goats over 18 months of age found dead or euthanized on your farm is extremely important. Without your help, we will not be able to declare the US free of scrapie, costing the sheep and goat industries approximately $10 to $20 million, annually. yourself on the clinical signs of scrapie. . Contact your or the for your state if your sheep or goat, older than 12 months, exhibits clinical signs of scrapie. Testing clinical suspects is the most cost effective way to find scrapie infected animals. samples or whole heads from sheep and goats over 18 months of age that die or are euthanized on your premises. Additional information is available on how you or your veterinarian can submit samples or whole heads for scrapie testing.
Contagious Equine Metritis (CEM), Contagious Equine Metritis (CEM) is a venereal disease caused by the bacteria, Taylorella equigenitalis affecting only the equine species. It can have significant impacts on reproduction. Treatment of CEM is usually successful. CEM has not been shown to be zoonotic. The United States is considered CEM free and therefore it is a Foreign Animal Disease reportable at both the Federal and State level. Horses imported to the United States must meet certain import criteria or undergo CEM quarantine procedures at an approved facility to demonstrate freedom of CEM. Prevention is based on screening of animals from endemic areas (in other words breeding only known negative animals) and proper precautions during breeding (biosecurity) to minimize contamination or transmission. There is no vaccine available. CEM is transmitted primarily through live cover breeding; with stallions as the major source of disease spread. Infection can occur during artificial insemination or be introduced via contaminated breeding or other equipment (fomites). Stallions show no signs of disease and serve as carrier animals for spreading CEM. Once the bacteria is introduced to a mare, clinical signs will usually appear 10 -14 days later. Clinical signs in mares may include:
